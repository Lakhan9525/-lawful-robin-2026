    <!-- Question and answers session starts here -->
    <div class="queAndAnswer"> 
        <h1>Frequently asked questions</h1>
<h2>Why is Mentimeter free? Will it stay free even in the future?</h2>
<p>At Mentimeter, we think this kind of service should be as simple as possible, which also implies that it should be free. We offer different plans so that you can get more features, and we continuously revise our plans to ensure maximum value while maintaining a sustainable business.</p>

<h2>Will you store my credit card information?</h2>
<p>We do not see or process your credit card information. All payment details are handled by our payment provider (Braintree) to maximize security. Braintree has extensive documentation about their data security procedures.</p>

<h2> don't want to pay by credit card, do you have other options?</h2>
For Mentimeter Pro or our Conference packages we can offer invoices payable through bank transfer (Swedish Bank Giro, or IBAN and SWIFT for international payments) as a payment option. To request an invoice to pay via bank transfer, click here.</p>

<h2>Can I pay for one month?</h2>
<p>No. For Mentimeter Pro and Basic, we only offer yearly subscriptions. If you really, really need Mentimeter only for a one-time event, such as a conference, we have you covered. Read more about our Conference deals here.</p>

<h2>Why do you offer annual payments?</h2>
<p>Our mission is to make all meetings fun, interactive and productive. Why have boring meetings? We want our presenters and meeting leaders to use Mentimeter for many occasions: workshops, events, decision meetings, training sessions, all employee meetings and much more.</p>

<h2>What if I change my mind?</h2>
<p>If you wish to cancel within fourteen (14) days from the day you purchased and you have not successfully used Mentimeter at a live event, you will receive a full refund.</p>

<h2>Do you have special pricing for K-12?</h2>
<p>For individual licenses, see the plan options at the top of this page. To enquire for 10 or more licenses, please contact us at custom@mentimeter.com to request a quote.</p>

<h2>Do you have a discount for non-profit organizations?</h2>
<p>Please contact us at hello@mentimeter.com with a short description of the organization.</p>

<h2>Which question types do you have?</h2>
<p>Mentimeter features many different ways in which you can interact with your audience. Ranging from standard Multiple Choice and Open Ended questions, you can also create Word Clouds or play Quizzes with your audience. See our features page or our guides for more information about the different question types.</p>

How many questions can I ask with a free account?</h2>
<p>The free account is limited to 2 questions (of any type) and 5 Quiz questions. If you need more questions, you can simply create another presentation!

<h2>What is the difference between a question type and a quiz?</h2>
<p>Quiz is one of our question types, but it works a bit differently. The Quiz is a competition, and the results from all Quiz questions in one presentation will add up to determine one final winner! That’s why you can create more Quiz questions with a free account - the fun increases exponentially* with each question. *) not scientifically proven

<h2>What will the exported results look like?</h2>
<p>Exporting your result to Excel lets you further analyze the data afterwards, either per question or per voter. You can read more about exporting in our Help Center!

<h2>What is "Customize & brand"?</h2>
<p>"Customize and brand" means that you can customize the presentation to look exactly like you want it to, with your own background and colors both in the presentation and in the audience’s phones.

<h2>Can I share log-in with a friend?</h2>
<p>No. This will cause unexpected behavior and it is a violation of our terms of use. But hey, an account is free and we have the ability to share questions and themes in between presenters with the Mentimeter Pro plan. The Pro plan gives you the option to create your own team by adding more licensees to the subscription.

<h2>I want to use the same presentation in several locations at the same time. Is this possible?</h2>
<p>Yes, it is possible if you have a Pro account and share the presentation within your team so that it can be accessed from different accounts.
